Spotify Recommender Project by David Ahn, Tony An, Nate Lao

This project is a Spotify Recommender that recommends artists and playlists given the needs and wants
of a user by taking that user's Spotify data. 

We addressed the following categories:

Advanced Topics: Recommendations in social networks
Social Networks: We looked through the relationships between users and their favorite artists as well
as those favorite artists' related artists to optimally recommend new artists to a user.
Physical Networks (Internet): We used similarity measures to recommend playlists to user.

In this project, Nate handled a part of the recommendation algorithms as well as the Java server necessary
to link the user's Spotify account to our program.

Tony worked with the user interface so that requests for particular genres of music/playlists could be
requested.

David worked on the recommendation algorithms as well, using similarity measures to recommend playlists
in a versatile manner.

Initially, we wanted to create a Facebook friend recommender using the Facebook API, and wrote our project 
proposal on this. However, after speaking to our TA, we realized that this would be difficult given the
uninformative and obscure nature of the Facebook API.

Thus, we decided to use the Spotify API and implement a Spotify Recommender that flexibly recommends 
artists, playlists, etc... to a user.
